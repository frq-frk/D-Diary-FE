# D Diary (Digital Diary)

D Diary is a me time app. To record your day and to reflect on yout experiences and more importantly your reactions to them. We are trying here to bring a platform that helps to connect yourself.

## Features

- Diary (writing today's entry and reading past entries)
- Profile with editable goals (weekly, monthly, short term and long term)
- Mood Analyser (coming soon)
- Todo App (consisiting of different types of todo lists to follow)
- Memo (customizable)

### Diary

- It consists of two pages for now, to enter today's entry (one entry per day, can't be deleted or edited), to read past entries (with page flip animation)
- Mood analyser will be coming soon that helps you to reflect your emotional status from past entries. We are trying out best to give accurate results using Natural Language Processing models.
- Working on the speech to text feature to ingrate in today's entry page. It is customizable if to use it or not.

### Profile

- This reflects your profile with your joining month and year along with total entries created in Diary till date.
- It also has a set of goals that keep displaying on the dashboard. (A timer and a reminder to update the goals will be implemented)
- Need to work on to get close to real life features.

### Mood Analyser

- It is a feature that gets input from diary entries and relects its analysis on you mood from past days.
- Will make it advance with time. 

### Todo App

- It's a list of things that are personal to the user to be done.
- Different types of todo's will be introduced e.g todo related to a specific time (like things to do while getting ready to go to office or vacation).
- It is customizable at the app level as well as at the todo level.

### Memo

- It is a piece of small reminders grouped together as one depending up on the self help books you choose. (similar to goals in profile).

## Future Scope

- Introducing a space where people can choose to share their specific day entries into that space anonymously (profession from bio) and all other user can read them and give reactions anonymously no comments no sharing.

## usage
- A regular SignUp and SignIn using a valid email password or google and Facebook. (Will try to bring more SignIn/SignUp options)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
